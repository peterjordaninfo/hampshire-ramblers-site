# Welcome to Hampshire Ramblers

![Ramblers in a winter scene pausing for a joke.](/images/winterhero.jpg)

We are part of the Ramblers, Britain’s walking charity. The Hampshire Area of the Ramblers has over 4,000 members in 15 groups. Each week the groups lead a wide range of walks in Hampshire and our neighbouring counties. They will be delighted to welcome you.

The Ramblers exist to facilitate, for the benefit of everyone, the enjoyment and discovery that walking outdoors can bring; and to promote respect for the life of the countryside. We encourage walking; protect rights of way; defend the beauty of the countryside; and have campaigned for many years for the freedom to roam over uncultivated, open country.

The Area Council represents our 13[^1] area and 2 age-related groups to local authorities and to the Ramblers' National Council.

The more local [Area Groups]({{< ref "area-groups.md" >}}) are at the heart of the Ramblers - where volunteers lead walks, protect rights of way and maintain footpaths. To get the most out of the Ramblers, we encourage you to join a local group.
