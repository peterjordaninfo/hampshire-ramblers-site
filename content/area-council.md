In the Ramblers, the Area serves as the vital strategic bridge between our local walking Groups, the national Central Office and our local highway authorities, currently Hampshire County Council, Portsmouth City Council and Southampton City Council.

## The Role of Hampshire Area

We are one of 59 Areas across Great Britain. While local Groups focus on  inspecting and maintaining paths, organising group walks or running local campaigns; the Area Council has a more strategic role. Our main functions include:

* __Coordination__: Connecting the 15 local Groups within their boundaries to ensure they work together and follow national strategy.
* __External Liaison__: Acting as the primary point of contact for local government (Highway Authorities), MPs, and other regional charities.
* __Rights of Way Oversight__: Monitoring footpath issues that cross group boundaries and coordinating with local Footpath Secretaries to protect the path network.
* __Governance & Finance__: Managing the Area budget, distributing funds to local Groups, and ensuring that all activities comply with charity law and Ramblers policies.

## The Area Council

The Area Council is the governing body of the Area. It is not just a meeting; it is the decision-making entity that holds the legal responsibility for our area.

As well as the honorary officers of Chair, Secretary and Treasurer the council includes representatives from the groups, specialist officers (such as the Area Footpath Officer) and representatives from some affiliated local walking clubs that have joined the Ramblers.

The Council meets every quarter and holds an Annual General Meeting each year. Any member of a Ramblers Group in Hampshire can attend the AGM - to vote on regional issues, elect the Council members and nominate two delegates to the national [General Council](https://www.ramblers.org.uk/about-us/general-council).
