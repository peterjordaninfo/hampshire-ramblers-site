## 1. Where does this arrangement apply?

The notification arrangement applies to all parts of the MoD Training Estate in **North East Hampshire** and **North West Surrey** where Byelaw access is permitted.

* **Managed Access Land:** Most of these areas are marked on OS maps with **open red triangles**.
* **Range Danger Areas:** Marked with **solid red triangles**. These are usually live-firing ranges where public access is strictly restricted.

## 2. What about Public Rights of Way?

Public Rights of Way (PRoW) are generally **not affected** by this arrangement, unless subject to "red flag" restrictions (see below).

## 3. What other MoD sites are involved?

* **Ash Ranges:** Managed by a "red flag" system. When red flags are down, access is permitted through specific gates.
* **Chilcomb Ranges:** No public access beyond the rights of way that cross the area.
* **Thorney Island (West Sussex):** Access is strictly limited to the perimeter Right of Way.

## 4. Are there notices to indicate MoD boundaries?

Yes. Boundaries are generally marked with signs displaying military byelaws and access information.

## 5. What about "Red Flag" areas?

These are typically labeled as **"Danger Area"** on OS maps. When **Red Flags** (day) or **Red Lights** (night) are displayed, public access is strictly prohibited. Even when flags are down, stay on designated routes to avoid unexploded ordnance.
