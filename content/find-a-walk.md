When you join the Ramblers, we encourage you to join [a local group](https://www.ramblers.org.uk/go-walking/ramblers-groups). You'll then be part of a local community of walkers and rights of way volunteers. You'll be invited to join a mailing list to get alerts of upcoming group walks.

But, as a member, you'll find a welcome at Ramblers group walks throughout the country.

You can search for walks on the [national Ramblers website](https://www.ramblers.org.uk/go-walking/group-walks) or app.

Just remember to check out the walk details for any requirements or warnings, such as letting the leader know in advance that you will be attending.
