When you join the Ramblers, we encourage you to join [a local group](https://www.ramblers.org.uk/go-walking/ramblers-groups). You'll then be part of a local community of walkers and rights of way volunteers.

## Find a Ramblers walk

A a group member you'll be invited to join a mailing list to get alerts of upcoming group walks. You'll also find a warm welcome at Ramblers group walks throughout Hampshire and, indeed, the country.You can search for walks on the [national Ramblers website](https://www.ramblers.org.uk/go-walking/group-walks) or app.

Just remember to check out the walk details for any requirements or warnings, such as letting the leader know in advance that you will be attending.

## Find a walking route

Sometimes you might want to take a walk at your own pace and the Rambler website has a [library of over 4,000 tried-and-tested routes](https://www.ramblers.org.uk/go-walking/routes) across the country. There are long and short, easy and challenging options.
