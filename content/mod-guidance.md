**To: All Ramblers walks leaders wishing to utilise the MoD Training Estate in Hampshire and Surrey.**

Many of you will be aware of the guidance about walks planned to take place on MoD land locally which was published in 2014 on the Hampshire and Surrey Area websites. After more than 6 years, this advice has been updated to reflect the current situation.

**This guidance document updates and replaces the 2014 version.**

## Background

The Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) administers MoD land to enable army training to be undertaken safely. Recently, there has been some confusion regarding the requirement to notify walks in advance. The MoD has increased its use of these lands for training as forces have withdrawn from areas in Germany and elsewhere.

The Ramblers are members of the **Local Access Forums**, which established an MoD Liaison group to work with the military on all aspects of access. Representatives from Hampshire and Surrey Ramblers met with the DIO recently to clarify the situation for groups of walkers.

## Notification Procedure

Public access to MoD land is determined by Byelaws (currently under review). In the meantime, we have agreed that walk leaders will notify the details of any walk that enters MoD lands.

* **Contact:** Email Dean Howard (DIO) at [Dean.Howard966@mod.gov.uk]
* **Required Details:**
  * Date and time of the walk.
  * Proposed route on MoD lands.
  * Contact email and telephone number.

### How the System Works

The walk will be entered into the DIO log. If a clash with a training exercise occurs, the DIO will contact the walk leader to manage the potential conflict.

> **Please Note:** This is **NOT** a booking system for Ramblers Groups. It is an exchange of information to determine if particular parts of the Training Estate are in use on a specific day.

## Emergency Protocol

If you have an emergency while on MoD lands (e.g., you require an ambulance), you **must** contact the DIO so they can facilitate access for emergency vehicles.

**Emergency Contact Numbers:** **01420 483405** or **01420 483407**
