At the Ramblers, we do everything we can to make sure everyone, everywhere can enjoy walking in nature. And our volunteers are at the very heart of this work. Together, we can achieve so much more.

## Volunteering opportunities in Hampshire

There are lots of ways to volunteer in Hampshire.

* __Walk Leader__ for your local group
* __Don’t Lose Your Way Researcher__, to research, apply for, and save lost paths
* __Joining your Group or Area committee__
* __Path Watcher__, walking the Rights of Way in a local patch, logging and reporting any problems with signage and access to the Hampshire Countryside Service Team
* __Path clearance work__, helping to keep footpaths clear and walkable

### Volunteer resources

The central Ramblers website has lots of information about volunteering, together with resources and a training library.

In Hampshire, the FPAWE sub-committee has developed a range of best practice guidance to explain how the Area's objectives are implemented and to advise volunteers on how they should approach the tasks. You can download the following PDFs:
