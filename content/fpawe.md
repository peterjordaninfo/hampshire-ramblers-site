The Footpath and Walking Environment sub-committee (FPAWE)'s role is to carry forward, in Hampshire, the Ramblers charitable objectives relating to rights of way, access to the countryside and the protection and enhancement of the walking environment.

It provides:

* Advice and guidance to the Area Council on all Footpath, access and walking environment matters in the Area
* Co-ordinates the work of the individual Hampshire Groups by making representations on behalf of the Area Council to the highway and local planning authorities, to Ramblers Central Office and to other external bodies where appropriate

The FPAWE sub-committee has developed a range of guidance to explain how the Area's objectives are implemented and to advise volunteers on how they should approach the tasks.
