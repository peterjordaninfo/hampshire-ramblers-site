Hampshire County Council is the Highways Authority for most of our area and has lots of information about rights of Way in the county:

* [Using public rights of way](https://www.hants.gov.uk/landplanningandenvironment/rightsofway/usingrightsofway)
* [The Definitive map of public rights of way](https://maps.hants.gov.uk/rightsofwaydefinitivemap/)

Hampshire County Council publishes temporary Rights of Way closures and diversions, together with other changes or disruptions on its [Map of Public Rights of Way](https://maps.hants.gov.uk/rightsofwaydefinitivemap/largemap). Look for the routes marked in red and click on the route).

## Hampshire Countryside Access Forum

HCAF is an independent statutory body with members who represent the views of recreational users, land managers and others with an interest in countryside access. The main function of this group is to look at how the public rights of way network and access land is managed and improved. [Find out more](https://www.hants.gov.uk/landplanningandenvironment/countryside/hcaf).

## Footpath and Walking Environment sub-committee

The Area Council has a sub-committee responsible for [footpaths and the walking environment]({{< relref "fpawe.md" >}}).

It provides a range of guidance for volunteers.
