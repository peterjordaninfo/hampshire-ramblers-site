Hampshire County Council is the Highways Authority for most of our area and has lots of information about Rights of Way in the county:

* [Using public rights of way](https://www.hants.gov.uk/landplanningandenvironment/rightsofway/usingrightsofway)
* [The Definitive map of public rights of way](https://maps.hants.gov.uk/rightsofwaydefinitivemap/) 

Hampshire County Council publishes temporary Rights of Way closures and diversions, together with other changes or disruptions on its [Map of Public Rights of Way](https://maps.hants.gov.uk/rightsofwaydefinitivemap/largemap). Look for the routes marked in red and click on the route).
